# Hack The Future 2018
ðŸ’¥ Soon after the discovery of the Artifact several days ago, the experts began detecting sporadic, unintelligible signals, transmitted planet-wide, seemingly originating from within the object itself. ðŸ‘½

Local scientists have put forward several theories on the nature of the signals, though there is no definitive answer as of yet. It could be some sort of intergalactic communication device, or possibly a location beacon of some sort, potentially gathering information about our civilization and technological capabilities. And so we turn to you, our masterful hackers, to apply IoT, advanced machine learning and other state-of-the-art technologies to localize and decrypt all the Artifactâ€™s signals.

The ðŸŒŽ as we know it may be at an end. Every minute counts.


## Business case

The Artifact has hieroglyphs drawn onto it. Those hieroglyphs light up from time to time, are this the
signals that were mentioned before?
This will be your job; capture all the hieroglyphs that light up with your camera and pass them to the
IoT server. Create a dashboard to retrieve and visualize those hieroglyphs. Make sure you can send
them to be analysed and decoded by a Machine Learning algorithm.
